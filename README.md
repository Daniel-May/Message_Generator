# Message_Generator

##This README file describes the Message_Generator project that I completed as part of my Codecademy journey!

**Tech Stack Used To Develop This Project:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JAVASCRIPT
- GIT Bash Command Line
- Node.js

### Project Requirements

Initially the project required a message to be displayed formed of 3 separate parts of data to present "Mixed Messages".
As a mainly back-end focused project I used a Javascript array to store and access the data required, I then decided to include images along with the messages being 
displayed in order to improve the visual appeal.

### Testing & Deployment

Whilst working on this project I used git bash to keep track of my changes and made regular commits so that I could account for all changes to the code
that I was developing.

The backend Javascript was testing using Node.JS within the VS Code environment, I did try and keep all of my tech stacks in one place so that I could maintain
efficient coding.

Once I had removed all of the bugs I could find in the code I then added some basic color and styling to the front-end for visual appeal.

### Running Requirements

This generator should run in most browsers without issue.
